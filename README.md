# Heart Failure Prediction: Analytics and Tuning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores heart failure prediction using various analytics and model tuning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model optimization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, manually install common dependencies such as:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dv821/Heart-Failure-Prediction.git
   cd Heart-Failure-Prediction
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart-failure-prediction-analytics-and-tuning.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis contains medical records related to heart failure patients. Ensure that the dataset is available in the correct path before running the notebook.
